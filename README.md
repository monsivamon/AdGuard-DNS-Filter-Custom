# AdGuard DNS Filter for Personal Use

This is a custom AdGuard DNS filter list, created primarily for personal learning and experimentation.
Please note that I am still learning GitHub and filter creation, so this repository may not follow all best practices or produce perfect results.

## üìå Important Notes

- This filter is intended for testing and personal use only.
- I do not guarantee its effectiveness in blocking ads, trackers, or harmful content.
- Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any issues caused by using this filter.

## üîß Filter Creation Process

- The filter list is first generated using the [AdGuardTeam/HostlistCompiler](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler).
- Then, shell scripts are used to clean and customize the filter list.
- These customizations include filtering out non-existent domains by checking them with [massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns).
- Please note that these modifications are unofficial and might reduce the effectiveness of the original filter[AdGuardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter).
