# AdGuard_DNS_Filter_for_myself

This is a **custom AdGuard DNS filter list**, created primarily for **personal learning and practice**.  
Please note that I am still a beginner with GitHub and filter creation, so this repository may not follow best practices or deliver perfect results.

## 📌 Important Notes

- This filter is for **testing and personal use only**.
- I do **not guarantee** its effectiveness in blocking ads, trackers, or harmful content.
- Use at your **own risk**. I take **no responsibility** for any issues caused by its usage.

## 🔧 Filter Creation Process
- The filter list was originally generated using the official AdGuard DNS filter compiler.
- After generation, I used shell scripting to modify and customize the filter rules for personal use.
- The customizations include removing specific categories like tracking, analytics, and certain domains that were flagged by default.
- Please be aware that these changes are not official, and the filter may not work as effectively as the original.
